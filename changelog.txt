MAINTENANCE.SH CHANGELOG
# ================================
# VERSION 0.2a_october_9_2015 INFO:
# added extra text art and text color stuff to make it a little more interesting
# changed apt flags so no longer need to press Y to confirm
# added rkhunter stuff to update and run rkhunter
# added version notes
# added version number
# made rkhunter not require keypresses
# now displays number of lines in program
# lots of additional ascii art
# randomly picks one of five types of text art
# complete with color and all
# added text art for antivirus thing too
# decided to make it a little more interesting because why not
# gotta have a little fun with it
# otherwise this whole project would be incredibly boring
# ================================
# 
# 
# ==================
# VERSION 0.2a_october_9_2015-2 INFO:
# changed the order of rkhunter and clamav
# clamav stuff takes the longest so I made rkhunter go first
# changed timing on a few different things - increased sleep duration
# sleep duration change makes it easier to read output before it flies by
# ==================
# 
# 
# 
# =========================
# VERSION 0.3a_october_10_2015 INFO:
# removed the echo stuff about clamscanFunction
# uncommented clamscanFunction
# removed testing/demoing stuff
# now it's back to being fully functional
# =========================
# 
# 
# 
# 
# =====================~
# VERSION 0.4a_october_18_2015 INFO:
# added a couple comments here and there (documentation is very important)
# added speedtest functionality
# added network info function
# added variables (modemAddress and defaultGatewayAddress) for ping stuff (not yet implementedo)
# added function for displaying information about the above variables,
# which will be used for debugging purposes once I actually get around to implementing the
# variable substitution stuff for the ping test functions
# --
# idea for thing to add in next version:
# changing hard-coded addressing stuff for networking things
# to variables which can be changed easily so that they don't
# need to replaced every single time in the script
# made networkInfoEcho function and variables "defaultGatewayAddress
# and "modemAddress"
# --
# 
# more stuff I actually did change in this version though
# updated dependencies to include speedtest-cli
# updated to-do list
# added comments to final function invocation at near end of file
# added comments about changing colors for a terminal with a black
# background because currently this script is designed for a terminal
# window with black text on a white background but some of the text
# is specified as black so that won't really work on a black
# background I think
# be sure to read all these change notes and all the previous ones as well
# and back it up
# =====================~

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# VERSION 0.5a_october_24_2015 INFO:
# added echo lines to noteText function about using ctrl + c to exit program
# checked that the speedtest function was invoked (and it is, I just forgot)
# fixed typo in ending to-do comments
# added more ideas to to-do list of features to add (including debug mode
# for invoking user-specified functions and then exiting rather than
# proceeding with the rest of the usual program)
# made master function but have not done the debug stuff or if/read etc
# basically just put all normal function calls into a single function
# and then made a function call for the function call function
# and it's called MasterProductionFunction
# because production is differentiated from debug/testing
# and I will make some debug features later
#  
# added echo lines about how the network ping variable stuff hasn't been
# implemented yet even though I kind of implied that it had been 
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
# VERSION 0.6a_november_15_2015 INFO:
# noticed how the system I originally made this script for had black text
# on a white background, whereas I normally do white text on a black background
# for my own machines, so the black text which I colorized made it look bad
# like it was a different shade of black than the background but it was still
# super low contrast so now I added an if/elif/else statement that checks to
# see what the value of a var called "TEXTCOLOR" is called
# if it's BLACK then the regular text will be black (not counting the extra colorization)
# if it's WHITE then the regular text will be white (again, not counting special cases)
# replaced ping functions with multi-array iteration thingamajig (ping_test function)
# ping_test replaces the now-removed ping tests (use diff on backups if you want to view)
# ping_test should be invoked in MasterProductionFunction
# made function for errors, exit_message
# any error should then invoke exit_message and set a value for error_value 
# @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
# 
# April 2nd/3rd 2016:
# updated version number
# moved change log to dedicated file
# moved to-do list to dedicated file
# made backup of maintenance script
# moved maintenance files into dedicated subfolder of shell scripts folder of programming folder
# tested key_time_test.sh for something
# added debug mode, which should be firstly started in the (semi-blank) debugModeMenu function
# added debugKeyPress function, which uses the key_time_test.sh code to determine if the user want to enter debug mode
# added some text about debug mode choices
# disabled but then reenabled the speedtestCheck function because it appears to work now
# changed bannerFunctionNew to reflect the new state of the changelog and to-do list
# changed prettyLoader to say "proceeding" instead of "ok" so you don't get the wrong idea
